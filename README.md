# Wikipedia-Data-Exploration
Starting with the query of the Wikipedia API using pywikibot to get the links for the articles on horses, which we then mapped to their resolved IDs using the mappings from Wikidata.

Task:
- Explore data that on Mediawiki links,
- Document the usage of an API to retrieve wiki data.
- Details what: Trying to identify some interesting links (users & pages they edited, pages & page references, pages &topics, etc).

- Formulate one interesting research question in the beginning (e.g., Are most editors of wiki pages making frequent contributions to a broad range of topics on the platform or are they primarily occasional contributors with a narrow topic focus?) 3) demonstrate how your analysis attempts to address the question.

- Begin with some basic exploratory analysis of the data relevant for answering your research questions. E.g., look at some of the page revisions history and count various things like number of unique editors, number of edits within a one week period, one month period, size of edits and so on.

- Generate some plots (bar charts, histograms, violin plots etc.) to illustrate the exploratory analysis.

- Once identified an interesting link to explore, then construct a network from the data and generate a visualization of the network.

The task is intentionally design with the freedom to explore what you think is relevant and interesting. focus on being creative and scientific with how you approach the data.
